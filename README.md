AI Assistant Documentation
Overview
This document provides comprehensive details about the AI Assistant, a Python-based application integrated with OpenAI's GPT model. The assistant is designed to understand spoken user input, process it, and respond both in text and speech.

System Requirements
Python 3.x
Virtual Environment (recommended, e.g., venv)
Internet connection (for API calls and speech services)
Installation
Setting Up the Environment
Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creation: python -m venv venv
Activation:
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Packages

pip install python-dotenv SpeechRecognition gtts openai pyaudio
For macOS, additional setup for pyaudio might be required: brew install portaudio.
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root.
Add the OpenAI API key: OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here.
Usage
Run the script using the command:

bash
Copy code
python ai_assistant.py
Speak to the AI Assistant after the prompt. It will process the speech, interact with the OpenAI API, and respond both in text and voice.

Functionalities
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language into text using SpeechRecognition.
Text-to-Speech: Converts text responses into spoken language using gTTS.
OpenAI Integration: Leverages OpenAI's GPT model for generating conversational responses.
Custom Commands: Can be expanded to include specific functionalities like setting reminders or fetching information online.
Customization and Expansion
The AI Assistant can be customized and expanded by modifying the ai_assistant.py script.
Additional functionalities, like web scraping or API integrations, can be added as per the project's needs.
Troubleshooting
API Quotas: Keep an eye on the OpenAI API usage to avoid exceeding free tier limits.
Microphone Access: Ensure proper permissions are set for microphone access on your system.
Dependency Issues: If a module is not found, check if it's installed in the active Python environment.
Future Enhancements
Enhance natural language processing capabilities.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
Explore deployment options for wider accessibility.
Integrate with other APIs for additional features.
